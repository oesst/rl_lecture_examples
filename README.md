==============================

Here we introduce running examples for the (RL course by David Silver)[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ]

## Examples

* __Lecture 3 Policy Evaluation__: Grid world example from lecture sildes to demonstrate policy evaluation.
* __Lecture 3 Policy Iteration:__ Grid world example to demonstrate how the policy is iteratively evaluated and updated.
* __Lecture 3 Value Iteration__: Grid world example for policy iteration without explicit policy.
* __Lecture 4 Monte-Carlo RL__: Black Jack example from the lecture to demonstrae model-free prediction with Monte-Carlo
* __Lecture 4 Temporal Difference RL__: Black Jack example to demonstrae model-free prediction with Temporal Differecen Learning
* __Lecture 5 Monte-Carlo Control:__ Black Jack example to demonstrate Monte-Carlo policy evaluation together with $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm for control
* __Lecture 5 TD Control (SARSA)__: Windy grid world example to demonstrate TD(0) policy evaluation together with $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm for control
* __Lecture 5 Control with SARSA($\lambda$)__: Windy grid world example to demonstrate TD($\lambda$) policy evaluation together with $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm for control
* __Lecture 6 Value Function Approximation__: Mountain car example with TD(0) function approximation and tile coding for feature vector construction.
