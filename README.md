# Reinforcement Learning Course by David Silver

==============================

Here we introduce running examples for the (RL course by David Silver)[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ]

## Examples

* Lecture 3 Policy Evaluation: Grid world example from lecture sildes to demonstrate policy evaluation.
* Lecture 3 Policy Iteration: Grid world example to demonstrate how the policy is iteratively evaluated and updated.
* Lecture 3 Value Iteration: Grid world example for policy iteration without explicit policy.
* Lecture 4 Monte-Carlo RL: Black Jack example from the lecture to demonstrae model-free prediction with Monte-Carlo
* Lecture 4 Temporal Difference RL: Black Jack example to demonstrae model-free prediction with Temporal Differecen Learning
* Lecture 5 Monte-Carlo Control: Black Jack example to demonstrate Monte-Carlo policy evaluation together with $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm for control
* Lecture 5 TD Control (SARSA): Windy grid world example to demonstrate TD(0) policy evaluation together with $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm for control
* Lecture 5 Control with SARSA($\lambda$): Windy grid world example to demonstrate TD($\lambda$) policy evaluation together with $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm for control
* Lecture 6 Value Function Approximation: Mountain car example with TD(0) function approximation and tile coding for feature vector construction.
